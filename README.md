# Unsupervised-SNN---MNIST-Classification
A simple implementation of the unsupervised SNN model presented by Peter Diehl et al. It trains and tests an unsupervised SNN using the MNIST dataset. Still needs work to speed up calculations. 

To allow the MNIST dataset to be accessible to the code, unzip the MNIST file and save the whole folder (with the name "MNIST" in your C drive).
